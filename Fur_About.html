			<h2>What is a Furry?</h2>
			<p>In general terms, a furry is somebody who is an enthusiast for animal characters with human characteristics. Or they may just enjoy the art style of a fursona or an anthro character</p>
		
			<h2>What is an Anthro Character?</h2>
			<p>Anthropomorphic characters, Antro for short, are animalistic characters which have features of humans. E.g. An anthropomorphic animal may walk on its hind legs and have a human like figure</p>
		
			<h2>Why do People like Furries and Anthro Character?</h2>
			<p>Some people may just prefer being a furry rather than just a usual person and some people may just decide they enjoy the art style. It's up to the person really. They may decide they just want to be a furry cause it looks cool. My character, Neo, was made because I could relate more to it than being a normal person. </p>
