		<h1>Welcome to the Furry Fandom</h1>
		
		<p>This page is about the main furry fandom and about the people in it.</p>
		<p>Some people will always be negative about this fandom because it isn't too normal, however, people never really look into it to see how it is. There is a load of judgement from other people about the fandom being "Toxic" even when it is actually a safe space for most people. The content people have to give can be informational like videos by Pocari Roo. People like Pocari normally make informational videos, sometimes explaining the fandom or explaining how people can express themselves through the furry community.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

		<p>There are some negative parts because some people who may not be in the fandom, would scam others by selling stolen products such as fursuit commissions and fursuits. These people steal other pre-existing photos from the internet. However, these people are far and few between.</p>
